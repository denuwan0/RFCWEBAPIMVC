In this project, the primary objective is to establish a robust and reliable integration between SAP and non-SAP systems using .Net API, enabling smooth data flow and real-time interactions. The integration could involve various types of external systems, such as Human Resource management (HCM), Sales & Distribution (SD) platforms, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems from different vendors, custom-built applications, or third-party software.
